#ON CHAT- NODE JS

##About the Project
This project is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, WebSockets, and Redis. It provides instant messaging capabilities and ensures message delivery even if a user is temporarily offline. When a user disconnects, messages sent to them are stored in Redis. Upon reconnection, all pending messages are immediately delivered, ensuring a seamless user experience.
